In the second half of 2021 the number of internet of things (IoT) deals decreased significantly, by 75% from the same period in 2020. This marks a deceleration in growth from the 66.7% decrease in deals that occurred in H1 2021 relative to the same period a year earlier. GlobalData’s deals database looks at mergers, acquisitions, and venture capital and private equity investments taking place daily between thousands of companies across the world. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); During the second half of 2021, IoT deals accounted for 0.5% of all deals taking place in the sector. This represents a decrease from the figure of 2% in the second half of 2020. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information on investments to see which industries are best placed to deal with any issues they may encounter. These themes, of which IoT is one, are best thought of as "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night", and by tracking them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which ones have some work to do.
