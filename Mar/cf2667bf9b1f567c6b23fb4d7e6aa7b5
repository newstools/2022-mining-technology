North America extended its dominance for machine learning hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending December. The number of roles in North America made up 59.9% of total machine learning jobs – up from 46.8% in the same quarter in 2020. That was followed by Europe, which saw a minus one year-on-year percentage point change in machine learning roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, which tracks the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include machine learning, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements, it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels – and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was India, which saw 7.9% of all machine learning job adverts in the three months ending December 2020, increasing to 22.7% in the three months ending December last year. That was followed by the US (up 14.4 percentage points), China (up 0.7), and Canada (up zero). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for machine learning roles in the mining industry is the US, which saw 55.4% of all roles advertised in the three months ending December. Some 8.1% of all mining industry machine learning roles were advertised in Erie (US) in the three months ending December – more than any other city. That was followed by Milwaukee (US) with 8.1%, Advance (US) with 3.7%, and Pittsburgh (US) with 3%. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
