Research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) in the mining industry operations and technologies sector has declined in the last year. The most recent figures show that the number of AI-related patent applications in the industry stood at 14 in the three months ending January – down from 37 over the same period in 2020. Figures for patent grants related to AI followed a similar pattern to filings – shrinking from 17 in the three months ending January 2020 to three in the same period in 2021. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, which tracks patent filings and grants from official offices around the world. Using textual analysis, as well as official patent classifications, these patents are grouped into key thematic areas, and linked to key companies across various industries. AI is one of the key areas tracked by GlobalData. It has been identified as being a key disruptive force facing companies in the coming years, and is one of the areas that companies investing resources in now are expected to reap rewards from. The figures also provide an insight into the largest innovators in the sector. Honeywell International was the top AI innovator in the mining industry operations and technologies sector in the latest quarter. The company, which has its headquarters in the US, filed 21 AI-related patents in the three months ending January. That was down from 57 over the same period in 2020. It was followed by the US-based Caterpillar with five AI patent applications, and Japan-based Komatsu (2 applications). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
