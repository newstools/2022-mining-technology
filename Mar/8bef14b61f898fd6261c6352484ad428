North America extended its dominance for artificial intelligence (AI) hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending January. The number of roles in North America made up 53% of total AI jobs – up from 34.1% in the same quarter in 2020. That was followed by Middle East & Africa, which saw a -0.8 year-on-year percentage point change in AI roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, which tracks the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include artificial intelligence, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements, it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels – and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was the US, which saw 26.4% of all AI job adverts in the three months ending January 2020, increasing to 47.9% in the three months ending January last year. That was followed by India (up 10.4 percentage points), Mexico (up 0.1), and the UK (up 0.09). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Some 6.5% of all mining industry AI roles were advertised in Milwaukee (US) in the three months ending January – more than any other city. That was followed by Erie (US) with 6.5%, Atlanta (US) with 3.6%, and Phoenix (US) with 3.3%. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
