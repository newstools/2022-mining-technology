Mentions of industrial automation within the filings of companies in the mining industry rose 18% between the second and third quarters of 2021. In total, the frequency of sentences related to industrial automation between October 2020 and September 2021 was 34% higher than in 2016 when GlobalData, from which our data for this article is taken, first began to track the key issues referred to in company filings. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); When companies in the mining industry publish annual and quarterly reports, ESG reports, and other filings, GlobalData analyses the text and identifies individual sentences that relate to disruptive forces facing companies in the coming years. Industrial automation is one of these topics – companies that excel and invest in these areas are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges. To assess whether industrial automation is featuring more in the summaries and strategies of companies in the mining industry, two measures were calculated. Firstly, we looked at the percentage of companies that have mentioned industrial automation at least once in filings during the past 12 months – this was 75%, compared to 53% in 2016. Secondly, we calculated the percentage of total analysed sentences that referred to industrial automation. Of the 10 biggest employers in the mining industry, Honeywell International was the company that referred to industrial automation the most between October 2020 and September 2021. GlobalData identified 50 industrial automation-related sentences in the US-based company's filings – 0.6% of all sentences. ThyssenKrupp mentioned industrial automation the second most – the issue was referred to in 0.3% of sentences in the company's filings. Across all companies in the mining industry, the filing published in the third quarter of 2021 that exhibited the greatest focus on industrial automation came from Companhia Siderurgica Nacional. Of the document's 1,090 sentences, eight (0.7%) referred to industrial automation. This analysis provides an approximate indication of which companies are focusing on industrial automation and how important the issue is considered within the mining industry, but it also has limitations and should be interpreted carefully. For example, a company mentioning industrial automation more regularly is not necessarily proof that they are utilising new techniques or prioritising the issue, nor does it indicate whether the company's ventures into industrial automation have been successes or failures. In the last quarter, companies in the mining industry based in Eastern Europe were most likely to mention industrial automation with 0.22% of sentences in company filings referring to the issue. In contrast, companies with their headquarters in Africa mentioned industrial automation in just 0.05% of sentences. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
