Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include digital media, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels – and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was the US, which saw 32.1% of all digital media job adverts in the three months ending January 2021, increasing to 48.2% in the three months ending January. That was followed by India (up 10.1 percentage points), Australia (up 1.9), and Canada (up 0.0999999999999996). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for digital media roles in the mining industry is the US, which saw 48.2% of all roles advertised in the three months ending January.
