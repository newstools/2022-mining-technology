Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include big data, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements, it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels – and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was the US, which saw 32.3% of all big data job adverts in the three months ending January 2021, increasing to 49.2% in the three months ending January this year. That was followed by India (up 6.3 percentage points), Australia (2), and Mexico (1.3). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for big data roles in the mining industry is the US, which saw 49.2% of all roles advertised in the three months ending January.
