Research and innovation in big data in the mining industry operations and technologies sector is on the rise. The most recent figures show that the number of big data related patent applications in the industry stood at 23 in the three months ending January – up from 15 over the same period in 2021. Figures for patent grants related to big data followed a different pattern to filings – stagnating from seven in the three months ending January 2021 to seven in the same period in 2022. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, which track patent filings and grants from official offices around the world. Using textual analysis, as well as official patent classifications, these patents are grouped into key thematic areas and linked to key companies across various industries. Big data is one of the key areas tracked by GlobalData. It has been identified as being a key disruptive force facing companies in the coming years, and is one of the areas that companies investing resources in now are expected to reap rewards from. The figures also provide an insight into the largest innovators in the sector. Honeywell International was the top big data innovator in the mining industry operations and technologies sector in the latest quarter. The company, which has its headquarters in the US, filed 36 big data related patents in the three months ending January. That was the same as 36 over the same period in 2021. It was followed by the Sweden-based Sandvik with five big data patent applications, the US-based Caterpillar (3 applications), and Sweden-based Atlas Copco (2 applications). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
