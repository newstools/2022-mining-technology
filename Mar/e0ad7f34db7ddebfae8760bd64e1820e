US-based Boeing has suspended titanium purchases from Russian supplier VSMPO-Avisma in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reported Reuters. Last week, the aircraft manufacturer said it would suspend major Russian operations amid the Ukraine crisis. Boeing was cited by Bloomberg as saying in an emailed statement: “Our inventory and diversity of titanium sources provide sufficient supply for aeroplane production, and we will continue to take the right steps to ensure long-term continuity.” The firm said it would not face aircraft output disruption in the near term as it diversified metal sourcing arrangements since 2014 when Russia was hit with sanctions following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. In response to Boeing’s decision, VSMPO-Avisma said it ‘regrets’ the contract suspension with the long-term partner, Boeing. VSMPO-Avisma said: “We have been monitoring the situation in our country and worldwide, and we were prepared for this outcome.” As a result of Boeing’s decision, the titanium supplier said it is ‘reorienting its sales policy’ to other markets. Boeing signed a new deal with VSMPO-Avisma, which supplies nearly a quarter of global titanium, in November 2021. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) affirmed that VSMPO-Avisma will remain Boeing’s largest titanium supplier for commercial aeroplanes. Other aerospace firms such as Dassault Aviation and Safran are also seeking alternatives for sourcing titanium, which is used in the parts of aircraft, ranging from engines to fasteners. Dassault CEO Eric Trappier was cited by Bloomberg News as saying to reporters at an earnings press conference held last week: “We are trying to find alternatives, which exist, to cope with this new situation.”
