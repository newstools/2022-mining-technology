Research and innovation in cybersecurity in the mining industry operations and technologies sector has declined in the last quarter – but remains higher than it was a year ago. The most recent figures show that the number of patent applications in the industry stood at 11 in the three months ending November – up from 10 over the same period last year. Figures for patent grants related to followed a different pattern to filings – stagnating from 11 in the three months ending November last year to 11 this year. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, which tracks patent filings and grants from official offices around the world. Using textual analysis, as well as official patent classifications, these patents are grouped into key thematic areas, and linked to key companies across various industries. is one of the key areas tracked by GlobalData. It has been identified as being a key disruptive force facing companies in the coming years, and is one of the areas that companies investing resources in now are expected to reap rewards from. The figures also provide an insight into the largest innovators in the sector. Honeywell International Inc was the top cybersecurity innovator in the mining industry operations and technologies sector in the last quarter. The company, which has its headquarters in the US, filed six related patents in the three months ending November. That was up from zero over the same period last year. It was followed by the South Korea-based POSCO with four patent applications, Sweden-based Atlas Copco AB (4 applications), and the US-based Caterpillar Inc (3 applications). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
