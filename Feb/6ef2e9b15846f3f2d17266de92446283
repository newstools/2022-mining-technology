South & Central America was the fastest growing region for internet of things (IoT) hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending December. The number of roles in South & Central America made up 4.9% of total IoT jobs – up from 1.3% in the same quarter in 2020. That was followed by North America, which saw a 2.5 year-on-year percentage point change in IoT roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, which tracks the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include IoT, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements, it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels – and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was India, which saw 15.6% of all IoT job adverts in the three months ending December 2020, increasing to 30.2% in the three months ending December this year. That was followed by Brazil (up 3.6 percentage points), Canada (up 1.2), and the US (up one). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for IoT roles in the mining industry is the US, which saw 33.1% of all roles advertised in the three months ending December. Some 6.2% of all mining industry IoT roles were advertised in Atlanta (US) in the three months ending December – more than any other city. That was followed by Longview (US) with 6.2%, Perth (Australia) with 3.3%, and Belo Horizonte (Brazil) with 3.2%. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
