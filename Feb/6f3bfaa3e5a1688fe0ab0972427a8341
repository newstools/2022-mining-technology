North America extended its dominance for robotics hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending December. The number of roles in North America made up 68.9% of total robotics jobs – up from 64.7% in the same quarter in 2020. That was followed by Europe, which saw a four year-on-year percentage point change in robotics roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include robotics, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was Mexico, which saw 3.3% of all robotics job adverts in the three months ending December 2020, increasing to 8.6% in the three months ending December. That was followed by Australia (up 4.4 percentage points), India (up 3.7), and Hungary (up 2.9). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for robotics roles in the mining industry is the US, which saw 57.8% of all roles advertised in the three months ending December. Some 9.2% of all mining industry robotics roles were advertised in Milwaukee (US) in the three months ending December – more than any other city. That was followed by San Francisco (US) with 9.2%, Mexico City (Mexico) with 5.7%, and Pittsburgh (US) with 3.5%. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
