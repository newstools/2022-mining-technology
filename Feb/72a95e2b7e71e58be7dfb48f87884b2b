Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include fintech, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels – and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was Peru, which saw 0% of all fintech job adverts in the three months ending December 2020, increasing to 31.5% in the three months ending December.
