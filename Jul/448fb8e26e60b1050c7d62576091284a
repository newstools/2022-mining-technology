Raiden Resources has signed a native title and heritage exploration agreement (NTA) with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation (NAC) for the Mt Sholl Project area in Western Australia. The NTA will enable Raiden to engage with the traditional owners, through the NAC, to undertake heritage surveys across the 13 licence areas of the project. It aims to avoid areas of cultural significance using the traditional owners’ knowledge of the area. Raiden will undertake a heritage survey covering all of the planned drilling programme, late next month. The drilling programme intends to convert the JORC exploration target across three deposits at the project site to JORC 2012 compliant resources, assess platinum group elements (PGE) and cobalt mineralisation throughout the deposits, and test direct extensions of mineralisation. It will also focus on defining a mineral resource on the Kudos prospect and drill test-defined geophysical targets across the project area to outline new mineralised bodies. Raiden plans to start drilling upon completion of the heritage survey. Raiden managing director Dusko Ljubojevic said: “We would like to thank the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation for their support in reaching this significant milestone for Raiden. This NTA is a major step forward for the Company, with access now available for the drill definition of what we believe to be an exciting, and substantial, nickel-copper-cobalt-PGE project. “With the planning and evaluation phase of the project already complete, we believe that the Company is well placed to begin an aggressive exploration campaign, designed to convert the current JORC Exploration Targets into JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource Estimates as soon as possible.”
