Using textual analysis, as well as official patent classifications, these patents are grouped into key thematic areas and linked to key companies across various industries. Cloud is one of the key areas tracked by GlobalData. It has been identified as being a key disruptive force facing companies in the coming years, and is one of the areas that companies investing resources in now are expected to reap rewards from. The figures also provide an insight into the largest innovators in the sector. Honeywell International was the top innovator in the mining industry operations and technologies sector in the latest quarter. The company, which has its headquarters in the US, filed 60 related patents in the three months ending February. That was up from 24 over the same period in 2021. It was followed by the Sweden-based Atlas Copco with 10 patent applications, Sweden-based Sandvik (3 applications), and Japan-based Komatsu (1 applications). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Honeywell International has recently ramped up R&D in cloud. It saw growth of 60% in related patent applications in the three months ending February compared to the same period in 2021 – the highest percentage growth out of all companies tracked with more than 10 quarterly patents in the mining industry operations and technologies sector.
