The project is made up of the following areas: the Antapaccay Exploitation Zone, where mineral extraction and crushing activities are carried out; and the Tintaya Processing Zone, where the mineral processing activities are carried out to obtain copper concentrates, as well as the disposal of the tailings generated in the process. The property is near the company’s Tintaya operation and has reserves of 290 tonnes at 1.03% copper and the capacity to produce 100,000 tonnes per year.
