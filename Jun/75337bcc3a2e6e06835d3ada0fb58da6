BHP has selected Sandvik Mining and Rock Solutions for the supply of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for the Jansen Potash Project in Canada. Located around 140km east of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the Jansen Project is expected to be the world’s largest potash-producing mine, once commissioned. Under the contract, Sandvik will deliver ten underground battery-electric loaders and one electric tethered loader for the Jansen Potash Project. This project is expected to have an initial capacity of 4.35 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of potash. Expected to operate for up to 100 years, the mine is planned to start production in 2027. BHP Jansen Potash president Simon Thomas said: “Electric mining equipment is essential to meeting our goals to reduce emissions, improve productivity and most importantly protect the health of our employees underground. “Jansen will have the lowest carbon emissions per tonne of product produced compared to any potash mine operating today in Saskatchewan.” Sandvik intends to deliver the battery-electric loaders and other equipment from 2023 to 2025. Sandvik Canada business line manager Alex Willows said: “Sandvik electric loaders have been designed to best utilise innovative technology of its battery pack and electric driveline, and maximise the capabilities of our battery technology.” Planned to be developed in phases, the Jansen underground mine is expected to have a peak production capacity of 8Mtpa of marketable potash. The $5.1bn Jansen Project Stage 1 will focus on sustainability and technology, and the battery-electric loaders. Last week, Canada announced a C$100m investment to help reduce emissions at the Jansen potash mine.
